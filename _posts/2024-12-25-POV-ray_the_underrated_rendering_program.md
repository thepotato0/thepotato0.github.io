### recently, i came across a rendering program called POV-ray [in this video by shaneful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA24MVtBxcs)

# what is POV-ray ?
The Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer, most commonly acronymed as POV-Ray, is a cross-platform ray-tracing program that generates images from a text-based scene description. It was originally based on DKBTrace, written by David Kirk Buck and Aaron A. Collins for Amiga computers.

# the pov-ray experience
when you first install the program the text based interface seems a bit intimidating but once you start messing around with the interface you'll find out its actually really easy to write and render a scene.  

# render examples
